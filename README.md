# PowerShell XPath Filters for Log Analysis
This is a cheat sheet for writing XPath queries using the -FilterXPath flag in PowerShell.

Syntax is going to be a big part of this, with many examples and probably quite exhaustive explanations.

This will be written and organized in the style my brain learns, so I apologize if it's hard to follow.

DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS SUBJECT. I'm learning this as well, so if you have comments or corrections, please let me know.
