# Welcome!
Like a lot of people, I find that trying to teach someone else about a subject I struggle with is one of ***the best*** ways to get better at said subject.

That is the very reason I created this Repository.

This repository is my attempt at "teaching".\
I find topics I struggle with, and write them out as if I was teaching someone about them.

I also like to create cheat sheets, cause who doesn't like a handy little cheat sheet.
